# Click&Table
My evaluation project prepared during Python Developer course at Coders Lab

It is a website allowing customers to book tables in restaurants.

Options:
- Viewing and searching for restaurants is allowed to all website visitors. 
- Table booking and restaurant rating only allowed to logged users.
- Superuser mode allows to manage restaurants with their tables as well as categories and cities
